# Price-Optimization-Using-Python-
Price optimization is a strategic approach that uses data analysis and modelling to determine the optimal pricing of products or services. This process involves considering various factors, including market demand, competition, costs, and customer behaviour, to set prices that maximize profitability and market share.
# Price Optimization Using Python

## Overview
Price optimization is a strategic approach that uses data collection on sales, costs, competition, and market trends to predict demand changes and analyze price elasticity. This enables businesses to set optimal prices. It involves competitive analysis to monitor market positioning, customer segmentation to identify varying willingness to pay, and the use of mathematical optimization algorithms to determine the best price points.

## Dataset
To get started with the task of Price Optimization, we need a dataset based on sales, costs, competition, and market trends. The dataset used in this project contains features such as:

- **Fiscal_Week_Id**: The fiscal week identifier.
- **Store_Id**: The store identifier.
- **Item_Id**: The item identifier.
- **Price**: The price of the item at our store.
- **Item_Quantity**: The quantity of the item sold.
- **Sales_Amount_No_Discount**: Sales amount without discount.
- **Sales_Amount**: Sales amount after discounts.
- **Competition_Price**: The price of the item at a competing store.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code and analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models and results.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/price-optimization.git
   cd price-optimization
